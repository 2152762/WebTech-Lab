            About:
        </h2>
        <p>
            We, the students of Saint Louis University at Baguio City,
            are advocating for gender equality for those in Brgy. .
            We advocate because we want to help everyone, especially girls,
            women and those in the LGBT community, to defend themselves from
            those who mocked and hurt them just because of their sex, gender
            and not living up to the societal expectations according to their
            sex. We also wanted to help the boys and men to not give up on the
            pressures some people has put on them in order to be called a "real
            man", not to be ridiculed for their so-called "weaknesses" just
            because they have emotions and are humans just like women too, and
            to make everyone to be aware of their problems that have been
            regarded as problems of the female population only. In short, this
            advocacy's purpose is help everyone exert their rights as individual
            human beings who have their own individual differences, do not give
            in to the pressures of the society, strike the minds of the perpetrators
            of gender inequality with words, and inform everyone of their sex and
            gender-related issues that the media has often ignored.
