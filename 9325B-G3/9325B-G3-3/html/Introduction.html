                    As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said “When a man says to me, “I have the intensest love of nature,” at once I know that he has none." A lot can be taken in from this statement, but the one that stands out the most is the realization. We tend to act when something affects us directly or at the very last moment, and more often that not it is when it is too late. The environment has been, and will always be, part of our lives. Acting now is better than never.

                    1. Disseminate information about the status of the environment in the barangay.<br><br>
                    2. Provide enough information to inspire conserned individuals or organizations to take action. <br><br>
                    3. Overall improve the barangay's conditions through awareness.
